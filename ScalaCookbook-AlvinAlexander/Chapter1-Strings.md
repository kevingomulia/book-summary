# Chapter 1 - Strings

A Scala String is a Java String, so you can use all the normal Java string methods.

While the String class is declared as `final` in Java, you can add your own methods to the String class in Scala.

A Scala String have **both string and collection features**. The following code uses the `drop` and `take` methods that are available on Scala sequences, along with the `capitalize` method from the StringOps class.

```
scala> "scala".drop(2).take(2).capitalize // Chaining methods is called fluent programming style
res0: String = Al
```

## 1.1 Testing String Equality [COMMON]
You can test if two String instances contain the same sequence of characters by using the `==` operator. This `==` method does not throw a `NullPointerException` if a String is `null`. However, calling a method on a `null` string can throw a `NullPointerException`.

In Scala, you test object equality with the `==` method. In Java, you use the `equals` method to compare two objects.

In Scala, the `==` method defined in the `AnyRef` class first checks for `null` values, and then calls the `equals` method on the first object (i.e., `this`) to see if the two objects are equal. As a result, you don’t have to check for `null` values when comparing strings.

**NOTE:** In Scala, use an `Option` instead of using a `null` value (Scala does not have a `null` keyword)

## 1.2 Creating Multiline Strings
You can use three double quotes : `"""` to envelope the multiline strings. However, the lines will end up with whitespace at the beginning of their lines. You can add a `stripMargin` method to the end of the multiline string and begin all lines after the first line with the pipe symbol (`|`).

```
val speech = """Four score and
|seven years ago""".stripMargin  
```
This results in a true multiline string, with a hidden `\n` character after the word “and” in the first line.

## 1.3 Splitting Strings [COMMON]
You can use the `split` method that are available on `String` objects (like in Java).
```
scala> "hello world".split(" ")
res0: Array[java.lang.String] = Array(hello, world)
```
It is best to trim each string after splitting them. Use the `map` method to call `trim` on each string. `s.split(",").map(_.trim)`

To split a string on whitespace characters: `s.split("\\s+")`

## 1.4 Substituting Variables into Strings [COMMON]
To use basic string interpolation in Scala, precede your string with the letter s and include your variables inside the string, with each variable name preceded by a $ character
```
scala> val name = "Fred"
name: String = Fred

scala> val age = 33
age: Int = 33

scala> val weight = 200.00
weight: Double = 200.0

scala> println(s"$name is $age years old, and weighs $weight pounds.")
Fred is 33 years old, and weighs 200.0 pounds.
```

Prepending `s` to any string literal allows the usage of variables directly in the string.

In addition to putting variables inside strings, you can include expressions inside a string by placing the expression inside curly braces. e.g.

```
scala> println(s"Age next year: ${age + 1}")
Age next year: 34
```
You can also use curly braces to print object fields.
```
scala> println(s"${hannah.name} has a score of ${hannah.score}")
Hannah has a score of 95
```
The `s` that's placed before each string literal is actually a method.
### The f string interpolator (printf style formatting)
Using the "f string interpolator" allows you to use `printf` style formatting specifiers inside strings.

You can use string interpolation in ways other than just `println` methods. For example:
```
scala> val out = f"$name, you weigh $weight%.0f pounds."
out: String = Fred, you weigh 200 pounds.
```
### The raw interpolator
The raw interpolator **performs no escaping of literals within the string.**

Example:
```
scala> s"foo\nbar"
res0: String =
foo
bar

scala> raw"foo\nbar"
res1: String = foo\nbar
```
This is particularly useful when you want to avoid having a sequence of characters like \n turn into a newline character.

Common printf style format specifiers

|Format specifier|Description|
|---|---|
|%c | Character |
|%d | Decimal number (integer, base 10) |
|%e | Exponential floating-point number |
|%f | Floating-point number |
|%i | Integer (base 10) |
|%o | Octal number (base 8) |
|%s | A string of characters |
|%u | Unsigned decimal (integer) number |
|%x | Hexadecimal number (base 16) |
|%% | Print a "percent" character |
|\% | Print a "percent" character |

## 1.5 Processing a String One Character at a Time [COMMON]
Mostly, you can use the `map` or `foreach` methods, or a `for` loop. Here you can see what the Scala underscore character is useful for:

```
scala> val upper = "hello, world".map(c => c.toUpper)
upper: String = HELLO, WORLD

scala> val upper = "hello, world".map(_.toUpper)
upper: String = HELLO, WORLD
```

## 1.6 Finding Patterns in Strings
Create a `Regex` object by invoking the `.r` method on a String, and then use that pattern with `findFirstIn` when  you're looking for one match, and `findAllIn` when looking for all matches.

Example:

Firstly create a Regex for the pattern you want to search for.
```
scala> val numPattern = "[0-9]+".r
numPattern: scala.util.matching.Regex = [0-9]+
```
Next, create a sample String you can search:
```
scala> val address = "123 Main Street Suite 101"
address: java.lang.String = 123 Main Street Suite 101
```
The findFirstIn method finds the first match:
```
scala> val match1 = numPattern.findFirstIn(address)
match1: Option[String] = Some(123) // Notice that this method returns an Option
```

When looking for multiple matches, use the `findAllIn` method.
```
scala> val matches = numPattern.findAllIn(address)
matches: scala.util.matching.Regex.MatchIterator = non-empty iterator
```

`findAllIn` returns an iterator, which lets you loop over the results.
```
scala> matches.foreach(println)
123
101
```
An alternative to using the `.r` method is to create a `Regex` object.
```
scala> val numPattern = new Regex("[0-9]+")
numPattern: scala.util.matching.Regex = [0-9]+
```

An `Option[T]` is akin to a container that holds either zero or one values. If it contains a value, it will contain a `Some(T)` object. Otherwise, it will return a `None`.

The normal way to work with an `Option` is to use one of these approaches:
• Call `getOrElse` on the value.
• Use the `Option` in a match expression.
• Use the `Option` in a foreach loop

## 1.7 Replacing Patterns in Strings
A `String` is immutable, so you can't perform find-and-replace operations directly on it. So what you do is create a new `String` that contains the replaced contents.

You can call `replaceFirst`/`replaceAll` on a `String` and assign the result to a new variable.

## 1.8 Extracting Parts of a String That Match Patterns
Define the regex patterns you want to extract, placing parentheses around them so you can extract them as regex groups.

```
val pattern = "([0-9]+) ([A-Za-z]+)".r
```
Then, extract the regex groups from the target string:
```
val pattern(count, fruit) = "100 Bananas"
```
This code extracts the numeric field and the alphabetic field from the given string as two separate variables, `count` and `fruit`.

It’s important to note that with this technique, the regular expressions must match the entire user input.

## 1.9 Accessing a Character in a String [COMMON]
Use Scala's `Array` notation:
```
scala> "hello"(0)
res1: Char = h

scala> "hello"(1)
res2: Char = e
```

## 1.10 Add Your Own Methods to the String Class
In Scala 2.10, you define an implicit class, and then define methods within that class to implement the behaviour you want.

First, define your implicit class and method(s):
```
scala> implicit class StringImprovements(s: String) {
| def increment = s.map(c => (c + 1).toChar)
| }
defined class StringImprovements
```
Then invoke your method on any String:
```
scala> val result = "HAL".increment
result: String = IBM
```
However, an implicit class must be defined in a scope where method definitions are allowed (not at the top level). This means that your implicit class must be defined inside a class, object, or package object.

### Put the implicit class in an object
For instance, you can place the `StringImprovements` implicit class in an object such as a `StringUtils` object:

```
package com.kevingomulia.utils

object StringUtils {
  implicit class StringImprovements(val s: String) {
    def increment = s.map(c => (c + 1).toChar)
  }
}
```

Then you can use this `increment` method after importing: `import com.kevingomulia.utils.StringUtils._`.

### Put the implicit class in a package object
Place the code in a file named *package.scala*, in the appropriate directory. If you're using SBT, place the file in the *src/main/scala/com/kevingomulia/* directory of your proejct, containing the following code:
```
package com.kevingomulia

package object utils {
  implicit class StringImprovements(val s: String) {
    def increment = s.map(c => (c + 1).toChar)
  }
}
```
The import statement is slightly different: `import com.kevingomulia.utils._`

You can add new functionality to closed classes by writing implicit conversions and bringing them into scope (using the `import` statement) when you need them. A major benefit of this approach is that you don't have to extend existing classes to add the new functionality.

It is recommended that the **return type of implicit method definitions should be annotated**.
